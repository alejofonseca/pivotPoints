PIVOT POINTS APPLICATION
////////////////////////

In Engineering as well as in other fields like Economics, 
data is tested over some periods of time and represented 
graphically (in most cases). Some times, it is crucial to
estimate future values for data based on previous analysis. 
The Pivot Points theory is one of the principles that 
people use to accomplish this. It is very easy to use and
only requires the input of three elements: The highest and
lowest values the particular function has taken over the 
evaluated period of time, and the last value at which the
function was tested in the same time period. As a result
the application delivers three resistances or positive
pivot points, three supports or negative points and a 
central pivot point.

Simply enter the three values in the text boxes below and click the button to
calculate the results.
